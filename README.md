# Behaviorial Cloning Project

[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

This repository contains starting files for the Behavioral Cloning Project.

The project includes the following files:
* preprocess.py: contains the pipeline of preprocessing of image which includes resizing, changing brightness, cropping anad flipping.
* model.py: contains the script to create and train the model
* drive.py: drives the car in autonomous mode
* model.h5: contains a trained convolution neural network 
* writeup_report.md or writeup_report.pdf summarizing the results

## Results
The model is trained to successfully drive the car in autonomous mode in the simulator. The video is in this [link](https://youtu.be/EMU85g3EKGI) for the first person view. This [link](https://youtu.be/cT3uxYmHrc4) is for third person view.
